1
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.080
There is a long relationship between maps and flags,

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.500
and they are often printed on the same page.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
The canvas proportions are based on common flag ratios,

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.220
forming an initial link between maps, software, bias, and ideology.

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.040
It is only within the last few hundred years

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.560
that north has been consistently at the top of maps.

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.660
Early Chinese compasses were oriented to point south,

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.200
leading to maps with south at the top of the page.

9
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.980
This orientation was switched to north facing up maps

10
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.480
by an emperor, living in the north of the country,

11
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.220
who wanted to place others in a position of subjection,

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.420
looking up to his power.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.880
Up, like many other aspects of maps,

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.480
is a human construct based on power, history, and bias

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.480
rather than anything to do with nature.

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.280
Mapping projections are ways of taking

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.680
a spherical set of data like the globe

18
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.000
and collapsing it to a flattened image that can

19
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.560
be printed on a page or rendered to a screen.

20
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.320
Perfectly flattening the three dimensional globe

21
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.020
into a two dimensional image

22
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.180
is an impossible proposition that always

23
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.320
leads to distortions in proportion and scale.

24
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.300
These distortions, intentionally or unintentionally,

25
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.040
are influenced by the biases of the map maker.

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.140
Notions of center, scale, up, and down

27
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.520
influence the way the world is communicated to us through maps

28
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.260
and influences the way we see the world.

29
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.080
‘Worlds in Figures’ contains 121 different mapping projections

30
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.160
ranging from the year 150 AD to 2018.

31
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.500
Removing the clipping constraints

32
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.440
allows these projection algorithms

33
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.980
to extend beyond the bounds of the map or edge of the page.

34
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.940
Mapping projections can be applied to any image

35
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.240
by dragging it into the main window.

36
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.400
The color palette consists of 12 colors defined by

37
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.980
the Telecommunications Industry Association's TIA-598-C

38
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.580
Optical Fiber Cable Color Coding chart.

39
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.760
Cutting through the black outer layer

40
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.560
of a fiber optic internet cable

41
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.660
reveals 12 specifically colored inner cables.

42
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.380
And inside of each of those colored cables

43
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.380
is the repeated 12 colored cables,

44
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.680
all containing a single strand of glass

45
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.680
thinner than a human hair.

46
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.920
Through a combination of the outer color and inner color,

47
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.720
each of the 144 fiber optic strands

48
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.720
is assigned a specific number.

49
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.020
And just as flags have a relationship

50
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.960
to maps and ideology, so do networks.

51
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.140
Our current network of buried glass strands

52
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.840
did not descend from the cloud,

53
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.700
but rather has a history dating back

54
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.220
at least as far as the “Empire Girdle,”

55
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.760
otherwise known as the “All Red Line.”

56
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.280
This was the name given to the first telegraph network

57
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.120
to circumnavigate the globe,

58
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.420
which landed only in areas shaded in red

59
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.680
on maps depicting the British empire.

60
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.320
Cartographers have developed different systems

61
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.860
for communicating the relationship

62
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.460
between map projections and distortion.

63
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.020
The graticule, or grid lines of parallels and meridians,

64
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.920
are almost as old as the concept of the spherical earth,

65
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.340
and are detailed in Ptolemy's Geography circa 150 AD.

66
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.580
Tissot Indicatrices (or ellipses of distortion)

67
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.900
were developed by the French mathematician

68
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.140
Nicolas Auguste Tisso in 1859

69
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.840
to illustrate and characterize

70
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.260
distortions due to map projection.

71
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.000
In 1910, Edward Ayearst Reeves,

72
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.140
the map curator of the

73
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.640
Royal Geographical Society in London,

74
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.900
taught courses in “surveying and practical astronomy

75
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.600
for explorers, missionaries, army officers and colonial officials”.

76
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.240
In his lectures, he began using the profile of a human face

77
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.280
rather than the continent outlines, stating that there are

78
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.800
"those of us who can more readily appreciate

79
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.140
what the shape of the average man's head is

80
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.700
than they can the general form

81
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.700
of the land masses of the earth."

82
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.140
The idea gained momentum, possibly due to the fact

83
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.140
that human brains are evolutionarily

84
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.740
hardwired to recognize faces.

85
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.900
While Reeves employed a single profile of a face

86
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.040
that stretched nearly from pole to pole,

87
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.680
in 1946 the Russian cartographer,

88
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.340
Andrej Vojcechovic Gedymin,

89
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.220
inscribed the face twice,

90
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.800
once in the southern hemisphere

91
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.800
and once in the northern.

92
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.820
This technique for visualizing mapping distortions

93
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.400
has continued popularity in contemporary cartographic circles

94
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.000
and has been extended to software based implementations.

95
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.060
In addition to its educational uses,

96
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.480
there is perhaps also something poetic in Reeves' gesture,

97
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.160
in the implied suggestion that

98
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.240
in order to see how the world bends

99
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.480
we must first see ourselves.

100
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.420
However, if we look to these profiles,

101
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.720
“ourselves” is defined quite narrowly,

102
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.560
and this lens with which we use to look for distortions

103
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.800
is itself distorted with bias.

104
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.420
“Worlds in Figures” allows us to create our own

105
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.640
personalized geo-coded profiles

106
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.880
of the ones we know the most intimately.

107
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.620
The ones for which we will notice even

108
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.120
the slightest bend in any curve.

109
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.820
Just as maps are more like narratives than they are like rulers,

110
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.240
so is the software we make,

111
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.980
and the software we use on a daily basis.

112
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.680
These systems are narratives

113
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.820
similarly bent, intentionally and unintentionally

114
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.000
by the histories and biases of those

115
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.340
with the power to define which way is up.
